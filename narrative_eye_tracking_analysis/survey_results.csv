0,Not much,the settting,id20,4,4,1,5,1,4,3,4,2,The main character is creepy,,,
1,Like the descriptive writing and the set up for the story.,What the schoolmistresses' goal in life is,id7,5,4,3,4,4,5,3,4,2,"It was a good story, I didn't fully get the entire message but it was something to think about more.",,,
2,the character seems to be introverted and reflective ,does the character have any hopes or dreams?,id30,4,4,4,5,3,4,3,5,3,"i enjoyed many parts of the story, but I also felt a bit confused by the way the writer would skip around from memories to scenes taking place with our main character. Overall, the story seemed like the tale of a reflective person who is uneducated but still driven by her inner experience. ",few character interactions ,I dont think it did. ,not that I can think of. 
3,The protagonist is interested in learning a new language and that speaks to me as a reader because I enjoy education and languages.,How the protagonist will go about learning French with the teacher he was sent.,id27,5,3,2,4,2,3,4,1,2,This short story was interesting. It was like a discount version of Lolita. Nothing can top the original.,,,
4,The wide use of vocabulary. The unromantic depiction of the characters.n,"Is it originally written in another language? There are words that seem arranged poorly, as if translated quickly.",id11,2,4,3,5,1,1,4,1,4,"It displayed a rather outdated attitude towards women that was not charming, and hindered my ability to sympathize with the main character. Also, I was confused why the love interest was referred to by different names at different times. ",,,
5,The descriptions of the seasons that aid in understanding the character's feeling,More about the character's early life/how she got where she is now,id10,4,3,4,4,4,4,3,4,4,"Parts of descriptions were a little 'clunky' to read, but they were also rich, vivid, and generally added to the overall pace of the story",,,
6,It's new and different from what I usually read on a regular basis.,How we got here!,ID25,3,3,2,4,3,4,5,3,4,"It was interesting, but a little boring. I don't think there was a big enough hook at the beginning to capture my attention. It would have been helpful to have main characters that felt more relatable.",,,
7,I really liked the scene setting; the description was very vivid. And I could understand Marya's inner turmoil; it was described well.,If anything changes in Marya's life or if she stays stuck in the same place doing the same thing,id13,4,5,4,5,5,5,2,4,4,"It felt very Russian with its basic point on the bleakness and monotony of life. I was hoping something would happen to Marya that would change the monotony of her life, but it was not to be; it seemed like a story striving for realism. I did enjoy it though!",,,
8,"It's engaging; I liked the turn of phrase and how he doesn't seem to take himself too seriously. I do like reading period literature and this definitely has that feel of it (more Jane Austen than modern I'd say). It seems like it might be somewhat dry humor, which makes me pay attention more.","This is called Expensive Lessons so I want to know why they're so expensive, if he's able to 'overcome his innate laziness' to learn new languages, what his research is on, and more about this teacher.",id13,4,3,2,5,2,3,4,4,2,"This was an engaging story in that the scene was interesting and I enjoyed getting to know the characters at first but I don't have much patience for men like Vorotov imagining that they're in love with women who are just there to teach them and his self-arrogance and lack of self-awareness really put me off. While this amount of story was fine and engaging, unless there was some hint that Vorotov was going to become more self-aware and either hire a teacher that could actually teach him or ask Alice for her original lessons instead of having her translate and see if she's actually helpful, I wouldn't continue to read. I did appreciate the conclusion though and how it wrapped up with an answer to why the story was called Expensive Lessons.",,,
9,Interesting set up and vivid imagery. ,I want to know what happens to the heroine. ,id23,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,"Vivid dialog that I can relate to.  I am able to follow along at a quicker pace, starting out.",What happens to this individual as he meets the instructor.,id2,5,5,4,2,4,5,3,4,1,Engaging and a quicker read (in terms of understanding the plot/flow) compared to the one from last week.,,,
11,The descriptions of Voltrov,Why is he determined to learn french and Germann,id17,4,2,3,4,1,4,4,4,2,"I thought that the guy was kind of stuck up. he hired a french teacher, complained about the way she was teaching, and then when she changed it to how he wanted to be taught, he complained that he wasn't learning anything. Plus she was around 18 and he was a grown man so that was kinda creepy",,,
12,descriptive,how the conversation goes between the two characters,id21,4,2,3,4,3,2,3,4,2,"interesting story, slice of life, did not expect it will be about one sided love",,,
13,It is not too confusing to start.  Not too many details or characters to remember as the author/speaker narrates.,I am curious what happens to the school mistress on the pages ahead.  Page one was background info. about her parents and brother.,id2,5,4,3,4,4,4,5,5,5,It was an interesting read to see what was being narrated during this journey to a town in Russia.  I was not sure at first if the pages were in order in terms of the narration and the activity the school mistress and the two fellows were engaging in.,,,
14,The main character seems interesting.,What her childhood was like having had parents die when she was so young.,ID25,3,2,4,3,4,3,5,4,3,"It was good, more of an adventure, but I thought the sentences were very long which made it hard to keep up.",,,
15,It paints a clear picture of the scene,More about the life and emotions of the main character ,id15,4,2,4,2,3,4,4,5,3,I liked the story but I did not know what to expect from it ,,,
16,The phrase 'and again the school and again the road' is kind of marvelous.,Not much at present.,id18,2,3,2,3,4,3,2,4,3,It was okay.,,,
17,"The character seems likeable, I relate to my laziness in learning new language to him.",How to story progresses. Did he manage to learn French and German?,id8,5,4,5,5,3,5,3,5,2,It's a great descriptive story. I read it again and understood the story better so there was less confusion. Was it really all a dream of her being a school mistress or is it just a feeling for her? A memory that was brought back to her? The ending had me confused but overall a great story that shows a lot of connection to the characters as well as the scene description.,,,
18,The description of the main character's backstory and the language used to describe the scene helped me to create a picture in my head,What was the main character like as a little girl? How did she deal with the many tragedies that her family endured?,id16,2,2,3,3,3,3,5,2,4,"I thought the story wasn't very engaging. However, at the end when the author described the happiness of the main character, I was intrigued. The possibility that the whole thing could have been a dream made me see the story in a new light. The story was really descriptive about the environment around the characters, but I wanted to dive deeper into the characters that I was being introduced to.",,,
19,The characters have in depth descriptions  ,More about the young woman teacher,id15,3,2,4,3,2,4,4,5,2,The story was engaging because I wanted to develop an opinion on the two main characters  ,,,
20,Not much. It was not engaging,I would like to know what research is he conducting. What era is the story set. Feels like it started without much background explained. ,id19,3,1,3,3,2,3,4,4,2,It was ok. I'm not much into romance novels. But it was an ok read. ,,,
21,The descriptive language of the setting,"More about the main character, what do they look like?",ID26,2,1,3,5,3,2,5,2,4,I kept waiting for something exciting to happen... there were many run-on sentences that made it confusing to read. It was difficult to keep track of names/places.,,,
22,I like the description of the main character.,I'd like to know how is relationship with the French instructor would proceed.,id31,5,5,5,5,4,5,2,5,2,It was a nice and funny story. I liked that the author allowed us to gaze into the mindset of the main character.,,,
23,"The premise of the story and the well described protagonist, the problem described is open ended and I want to know how it turns out for the hero. ",Whether the hero's quest is worthy and succeeds. ,id23,5,5,5,1,1,5,1,5,1,"The characters are so life like. Loved the characters internal musings about women and stereotypes. Ending life like too, nothing heroic or evil. Just lukewarm uselessness of the whole affair. ",,,
24,Mayra seems interesting,if shes going to reconnect with her brother or find something happy to think about,id17,5,4,4,4,4,5,2,3,3,"It was good, i felt a bit bad for Marya, as she seems to be trapped in a kinda unhappy life. I hope she finds joy.",,,
25,"I like the nervousness of the character, it's relatable",... is he gonna fall in love with his new teacher??,id10,4,4,4,5,3,4,3,4,2,He should have kept his feelings to himself,,,
26,The dialogue feels realistic. I feel connected to the main character because of the descriptions of him.,I want to know more about Alice. ,ID26,5,3,5,4,5,5,2,5,2,"I felt emotionally attached to the characters, their inner thoughts, and their goals. I appreciated the description of both main characters in the beginning.",,,
27,"I'm not sure; I'm not getting much information that keeps me curious about it. The protagonist seems to live a hard life, in which she's isolated following her parents' deaths and losing touch with her brother, but that's a trope.","The point of the story, probably, if anything.",id27,2,1,2,4,1,1,5,2,4,"This one was more boring than the other one, in my opinion.",,,
28,I like the descriptions of how well the schoolmistress knows the area and how long she has been working there.,I want to know why she doesn't like the commute and what she is doing.,id3,4,4,4,5,5,4,2,5,4,I liked this story more than the other one. I enjoyed the depictions of the teachers emotions and the flashbacks. nnnn,,,
29,The contrast between the beauty of the scenery and the mundane existence of the main character.,Whether or not there is anything in the world that can bring back the colors to the main character's life.,id24,5,3,4,4,4,4,2,4,1,"A depressing tale of a mundane existence. However, it definitely brought out feelings, especially empathy, for the main character. The picture of the main character's childhood memories coming back in full colors, sounds, and smells, after years of such existence was very powerful.",,,
30,I like the descriptions of the character and his dress,I want to know what he is working on n,id3,4,3,3,5,2,4,2,4,2,"I thought it was kind of an odd story, especially with no background. Why does the man want to learn French? and if his intention the entire time was to learn by comparison and reading why did he hire a teacher? I feel bad for the main character but also embarrassed for him and maybe a touch confused by him. ",,,
31,I like that this man is making an effort to learn a new language.,"It seems the man finds his French tutor attractive, will this be a romance story?",id12,5,4,5,5,4,5,1,5,2,"Overall, I really liked this story. It seems as Alice is ashamed to be a tutor and wants to keep up a high-class reputation.",,,
32,it sets up the location and provides adequate background story to understand the environment where she grow up and live,i want to know whats next about her life and career or perhaps family,id14,3,4,5,5,3,3,4,3,4,the overall story is interesting but perhaps too much details were provided that makes the story a bit boring and i started losing a bit of interest reading it. I am not as hooked to it compare to the other story.,,,
33,Nothing,what will happen next,id19,1,1,3,3,1,2,5,4,4,I was confused of where the woman was. Was she in a cart led by horses? Was she in a car? Was she in a bar with other people drinking at a table besides the one she's sitting at? It was confusing,,,
34,"Slightly amusing predicament of the main character (a knowledgeable person, yet, for all his knowledge, lacking the ability to speak another language to use his knowledge effectively).",Whether the French tutor is a scam artist. Whether the main character can succeed. What benefits the new language will bring.,id24,5,3,4,5,4,5,2,4,1,Loved the story. It went in a completely different way I had imagined. The characters were alive and the overall descriptions made it easy to imagine the scenes.,,,
35,The main character seems interesting,What the main character's goal is with learning languages,id7,2,1,2,5,2,3,2,2,2,I didn't really like the story because I didn't like the perspective of the main character but I thought it was engaging. The main character didn't seem very likable and had a diminishing perspective of the tutor throughout the story.,,,
36,I like the amount of detail the story tells about the schoolmistress.,How did she end up with her current job?,id12,5,2,4,4,3,4,2,4,4,I'm wondering if it really was all a dream? Is it Marya's nightmare to be a schoolteacher and she was dreaming?,,,
37,"Nothing in particular, I dislike the usage of parenthesis for interjections so commonly.",The reading has yet to engage me to that degree.,id22,4,4,1,4,2,2,4,2,3,"Odd in some ways in word choice and grammar but overall competently written. I can't blame it for advancing the plot so rapidly and ending so abruptly given the shortness of the story, but I can say that within such a short period it tended to overuse the words which it used to describe the main characters. A bit more variation in how the woman was described would have gone a long way in terms of humanizing the main character, though it could be said that repetition is a sign of a sort of obsession, fixating on singular characteristics to the detriment of others. Broadly, the story was an alright read which articulated a pretty common situation which a person may find themselves in but it failed in attempting to bring the story and the characters to life due to its stilted writing and short run time.",,,
38,Not much,the settting,id20,4,4,1,5,1,4,3,4,2,The main character is creepy,,,
39,I enjoyed the narrative style and the description used for this story.,Would love to learn more about the school mistress and the part of town and life she is in.,id8,4,4,5,5,3,4,2,5,4,"It is about a story about this one young lady who is a school mistress. She is in a horse carriage and Seymon was the driver and there was this other man she deemed old but hot. Not gonna lie, I got confused with the plot. I thought she was the school mistress and it's probably going to be on her school life based on the title but it was different. At the end I thought her parents were dead too but they were alive? Were they really alive at the end? I need to know what happens.",,,
40,I like the description of how to her it seems like she has been doing the same routine forever and it would go on forever,what will be the 'event' of the story,id5,4,4,2,1,4,1,4,4,5,It is very old-fashioned- the dialogue sounds so stilted (could be translation too). I guess there wasn't really a plot- it's a recurrence of her thoughts and actions on the drive home from town? I did get confused a few times about why things were happening (why did they stop at that bar? was the drive very long?). I like the descriptions of her thoughts- about her work (felt very familiar!) and about her childhood. ,,,
41,The descriptions are interesting and there is a situation that is unfolding right off the bat,Who is the friend that recommended the teacher? What is the backstory of the main character?,id16,3,3,4,4,3,3,4,3,2,"The story was engaging, although it took a few pages for me to visualize what was going on. The way the main character viewed this woman was not something I agreed with, and his behavior throughout the story wasn't great. However, the bad behavior did keep the story engaging and wanting to see what happened next.",,,
42,vivid characters that begin at once down a path their excited by. ,what is the characters reaction to being around this women teaching him french,id30,5,3,5,3,5,5,2,5,2,it was very engaging and I enjoyed the unrequited love. ,almost nothing n,,
43,The imagery. I like how descriptive it is and the picture it paints.,I want a bit of a background into her life in Russia and her relationship with her mother.,id31,4,3,5,4,2,4,2,4,2,It's a nice story about Marya's life and all the factors that culminated into her being the headmistress. It also highlighted corruption in Russia.,,,
44,"Nothing in particular, I dislike the usage of parenthesis for interjections so commonly.",The reading has yet to engage me to that degree.,id22,4,4,1,4,2,2,4,2,3,"Odd in some ways in word choice and grammar but overall competently written.

Broadly, the story was an alright read which articulated a pretty common situation which a person may find themselves in but it failed in attempting to bring the story and the characters to life due to its stilted writing and short run time.",,,
45,the story makes me feel curious about the life of Vorov (the russian name),I want to know the purpose and the reason why the woman was visiting him (the russian guy). ,id14,5,5,5,5,4,5,5,5,1,"i think its a good story. i am not sure what the key takeaways or the moral of the story is but overall, i think the story is interesting. Perhaps it tried to explain how someone fall in love? So it started off like he is not interested in her and even wanted to stop the lesson. But he gradually grows more fondly of her and started to fell in love with her beauty.",,,
46,descriptive,why the main character's past is being described,id21,3,2,2,2,2,2,4,3,4,"it felt a little too descriptive and at times almost like a rant, though i felt her emotions were quite human ",,,
47,"It's okay.  It builds some sense that something unexpected may be happening to the main character.  Not thrilling yet, though.",Who really is this mysterious woman?,id18,3,1,1,4,1,3,2,4,1,"It felt... constructed.  It wasn't bad, per se, but not engaging.  It had run-on sentences, which was slightly distracting.  Moreover, though, it seemed as though it had... compulsive theming and re-theming.  It made me wonder if it were written by a machine?  Though I've had no reason to think that before reading it, it seems... to be how I'd de-construct ideas (the traits of the characters, etc.)  It wasn't unpleasant, but I wouldn't recommend it.",,,
48,The vivid imagery of nature. The resigned nature of the character.,Why do both stories have women with dead fathers? Why can't she leave her life going from the town to the school and back?,id11,4,4,3,2,3,2,5,3,4,"I liked the navel gazing of the main character, her thoughts were interesting. I didn't like the vague timeline. I could not place the story in its larger historical context.",,,
49,seems like it might be funny (altho I'm not a fan of fat jokes),will the man and woman have a flirtation. ,id5,5,5,5,5,1,4,1,5,4,!!! I was very interested but did not like the main character at all. I don't think I was supposed to (especially since he was described in such negative physical terms) but I still wonder how much the author was aware of how badly he made the character out to be. A typical 'nice guy.' ,,,
